Community Land Trusts in Appalachia
The definition of Appalachia is often considered the area the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) serves. Appalachia as a subregion faces many hardships. Mapping land trusts in the region show they are much less comoon in comparison with the rest of the country. Seeing that many counties face extreme poverty and don't utilize the housing trust model shows oppurtunity. Housing trusts are usually founded in urban areas but are not excusive to them.
